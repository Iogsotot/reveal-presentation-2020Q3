| 1             | Hello, everybody! My name is Anna and today I want to tell you about virtual DOM.  |
| 2             |What is DOM?
                 Simple definition – DOM – stands for Document Object Model. The key-word is Object, because DOM - It’s a way of representing a structured document via objects.
                  Hard definition - It is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with data in HTML, XML, and others.  |
